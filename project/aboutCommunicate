13 May 2014

This is a maintenance patch to make some low-level changes in preparation for releasing some new load-balancing options as part of the balance and fix balance commands. These changes are to underlying data structures to allow for more irregular partitioning of the simulation box.

The following commands are affected:

    communicate - deleted
    comm_style - new
    comm_modify - new
    balance - syntax changed
    fix balance - syntax changed

Note that the old communicate command has been replaced by the comm_style and comm_modify commands, which are more compatible with how other LAMMPS commands and options are structured.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY: The communicate command has been removed, and replaced by the comm_style and comm_modify commands. The syntax for the balance and fix balance commands has changed.

This patch file can be applied to the 11 May 2014 version. This is the list of changed files.
