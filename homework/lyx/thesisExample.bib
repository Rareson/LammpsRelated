	abstract = {In mineralogy, diamond (/daɪ(ə)mənd/; from the ancient Greek ἀδάμας – adámas "unbreakable") is a metastable allotrope of carbon, where the carbon atoms are arranged in a variation of the face-centered cubic crystal structure called a diamond lattice. Diamond is less stable than graphite, but the conversion rate from diamond to graphite is negligible at standard conditions. Diamond is renowned as a material with superlative physical qualities, most of which originate from the strong covalent bonding between its atoms. In particular, diamond has the highest hardness and thermal conductivity of any bulk material. Those properties determine the major industrial application of diamond in cutting and polishing tools and the scientific applications in diamond knives and diamond anvil cells.},

This method is further applied to show that the Young's modulus of graphene: 1. increases with increasing size and saturation is reached after a threshold value of the size; 2. increases from 0.95 {TPa} to 1.1 {TPa} as temperature increases in the region [100, 500]K; 3. is insensitive to the isotopic disorder in the low disorder region (\${\textless} 5\%\$), and decreases gradually after further increasing the disorder percentage.},

Lattices in three dimensions generally have three lattice constants, referred to as a, b, and c. However, in the special case of cubic crystal structures, all of the constants are equal and we only refer to a. Similarly, in hexagonal crystal structures, the a and b constants are equal, and we only refer to the a and c constants. A group of lattice constants could be referred to as lattice parameters. However, the full set of lattice parameters consist of the three lattice constants and the three angles between them.},

Three different methods of measuring the fibre Young's modulus(a resonance method, a bend test and a tensile test) are presented, together with recent results. Possible applications for such fibres include reinforcements in metal matrix composites (MMCs). "
